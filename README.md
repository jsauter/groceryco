Hi,

This is my implementation of GroceryCo.

Data storage is just csv text files in the repositories layer.  You can add new items you want to the catalog and the basket.

Catalog.txt
Name,Price,SalePrice

Basket.txt
Name

To run the application just build and run the exe out of the console project.  The files will be copies to the console project's bin folder, so you can modify them there if you like.

3rd party libraries used:
Ninject
CsvHelper
